### README

This directory contains the files for Turner Burchard's Stage 1 code for CSCI 494 Spring 2023.

`\data` contains the downloaded dataset from Torchvision, CIFAR-10

`pytorchImageClassifier` is the code which I wrote with the help of the PyTorch tutorial. Running `main()` should be all that is needed to run the code.
If it doesn't work, commenting out the Matplotlib visualizations can help.

`cifar_net.pth` is the saved neural net model.
